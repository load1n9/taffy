//! Taffy uses two coordinate systems to refer to grid lines (the gaps/gutters between rows/columns):
//!
//!   "CSS Grid Line" coordinates are those used in grid-row/grid-column in the CSS grid spec:
//!     - The line at left hand (or top) edge of the explicit grid is line 1
//!       (and counts up from there)
//!     - The line at the right hand (or bottom) edge of the explicit grid in -1
//!       (and counts down from there)
//!     - 0 is not a valid index
//!
//!   "OriginZero" coordinates are a normalized form:
//!     - The line at left hand (or top) edge of the explicit grid is line 0
//!     - The next line to the right (or down) is 1, and so on
//!     - The next line to the left (or up) is -1, and so on
//!
